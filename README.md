# risksr_OSF
This repository contains data and analysis script for the project on *Mapping the Cognitive Processes Underlying Self-Reported Risk-Taking Propensity*

It contains the risksr_OSF R project and a collection of subfolders containing code ("cpp" with the C++ implementation of the value updating model and its fitting procedure; "r" with the data preparation and analysis scripts), data (containing anonymized data from the pilot study), and plots (generated with the r analysis scripts).

Both the pilot and simulation R code files are numbered in the order in which they were executed (for the pilot analysis the data preparation script does not have to be run as the prepared data are already in the data folder).

To be able to run the simulation analyses, either first run the simulation code, or download the simulation_data.zip folder from the OSF repository, unpack it, and place it in the "data/simulation" folder of this repository.
